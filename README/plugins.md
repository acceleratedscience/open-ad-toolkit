# OpenAD Plugins

<!-- about_plugin -->
Plugins are how molecular tools and AI models are made available to the OpenAD client. They provide drastically simplified access to a series of advanced tools, and they make it easy for your own Python applications to interface with OpenAD.

Creating your own plugins is easy if you have a basic understanding of Python.

## Registration

Before you can interact with the plugins, you'll need to register with each individual plugin.

      <!-- ![Deep Search API key](../assets/ds-api-key.png) -->

2. Once inside the OpenAD client, you'll be prompted to authenticate when activating the Deep Search (DS4SD) toolkit. When running `set context ds4sd` :

    - **Hostname:** Default: [https://sds.app.accelerate.science](https://sds.app.accelerate.science)
    - **Email:** Your email
    - **API_key:** The DS4SD API key you obtained following the instructions above.

3. You should get a message saying you successfully logged in.

    > **Note:** Your DS4SD auth config file is saved as `~/.openad/deepsearch_api.cred`. If you ever want to reset your DS4SD login information you can run `set context ds4sd reset`, or you can delete this file.<br>

<summary>Register with RXN</summary>
<div markdown="block">

1. First, you'll need to generate an API key on the RXN website.

    - Sign up for an RXN account at [rxn.app.accelerate.science](https://rxn.app.accelerate.science)
    - Obtain your API key by clicking the user profile icon in the top right hand corner and select "Account", then select the "My keys" tab.<br>

2. When setting the context to RXN using `set context rxn` you'll be prompted to create a new auth configuration file:

    - **Hostname:** Default: [https://rxn.app.accelerate.science](https://rxn.app.accelerate.science)<br>
    - **API_key:** The RXN API key you obtained following the instructions above.

3. You should get a message saying you successfully logged in.<br>

## Sample Commands

    # DS4SD
    display all collections

    # RXN
    list rxn models

<br><br>

## Running Bash Commands (CLI)

To run a command in bash mode, prepend it with `openad` and make sure to escape quotes.
