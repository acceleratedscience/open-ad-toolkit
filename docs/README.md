### About This Folder

The text files in this folder are the "single source of truth" for descriptions of OpenAD and its core concepts.

When regenerating the docs, the text in these files is used to update:

-   The main [README.md](/) in this repository
-   The markdown files for [openad-docs] repo
-   The intro text that is displayed when running `intro` (see [/openad/helpers/output_content.py])

For instructions on how to regenerate the docs, see [/docs/generate_docs.py]
