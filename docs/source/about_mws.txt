Your molecule working set (MWS) is an in-memory list of small molecules that is the subject of your calculations and manipulations.

The MWS makes it easy to gather candidate molecules from various sources, either by adding them individually or loading them in batch from a dataframe or CSV or SDF file, calculate certain properties and then store them in your workspace as a molecule set.

When you launch the GUI and you click the bookmark icon on a molecule, it will be stored in the working set.

Please note that at this time the MWS does not support macromolecules, only small molecules.
