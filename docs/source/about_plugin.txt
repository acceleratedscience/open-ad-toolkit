Plugins are the way molecular tools and AI models are made available to the OpenAD client. Thanks to a unified language, accessing these tools through OpenAD lets you bypass a lot of complexity.

OpenAD comes preloaded with a number of plugins for literature knowledge extraction (DS4SD), forward and retrosynthesis prediction (RXN) as well as generative methods and property inference (GT4SD).

You can create your own plugins, and the publicly available plugins will soon include a much larger variety of open-source tools.

Note: Plugins are currently referred to as "toolkits" by the commands, however this language will be updated soon.
