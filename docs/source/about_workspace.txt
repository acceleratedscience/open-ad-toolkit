Your workspace represents an isolated environment where your molecules, molecule sets and other files related to your research are stored.

You can have as many workspaces as needed, allowing you to work on multiple isolated projects. Each workspace has its own command history and corresponds with a directory stored in ~/openad/workspaces. OpenAD comes loaded with a default workspace called 'default'.
