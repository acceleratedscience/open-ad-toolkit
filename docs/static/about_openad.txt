Open Accelerated Discovery (aka OpenAD) is an open-source framework developed by IBM Research, aggregating a number of molecular science toolkits into a single API that can be accessed by command line, a Jupyter Notebook and (soon) an API.

The goal of openAD is to provide a common language for scientists to interact with a multitude of of molecular tools to simplify the triage process and drastically accelerate your development timelines.
