Perform a retrosynthesis route prediction on a molecule.

{{USING_CLAUSE_OPTIONS}}
- <cmd>availability_pricing_threshold=<int></cmd> Maximum price in USD per g/ml of compounds. Default: no threshold.
- <cmd>available_smiles='<smiles>.<smiles>.<smiles>'</cmd> List of molecules available as precursors, delimited with a period.
- <cmd>exclude_smiles='<smiles>.<smiles>.<smiles>'</cmd> List of molecules to exlude from the set of precursors, delimited with a period.
- <cmd>exclude_substructures='<smiles>.<smiles>.<smiles>'</cmd> List of substructures to excludefrom the set of precursors, delimited with a period.
- <cmd>exclude_target_molecule=<boolean></cmd> Excluded target molecule. The default is True
- <cmd>fap=<float></cmd> Every retrosynthetic step is evaluated with the FAP, and is only retained when forward confidence is greater than the FAP value. The default is 0.6.
- <cmd>max_steps=<int></cmd> The maximum number steps in the results. The default is 3.
- <cmd>nbeams=<int></cmd> The maximum number of beams exploring the hypertree. The default is 10.
- <cmd>pruning_steps=<int></cmd> The number of steps to prune a hypertree. The default is 2.
