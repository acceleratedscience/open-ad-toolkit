The list of reactions can be specified as a string list, data frame or csv file from the current workspace. For data frames and csv files it will take the column with the name 'reactions'.\n\nIn the <cmd>FROM</cmd> clause reactions are defined by a list of reactions where are SMILES string is delimited by '.' e.g. <cmd>'BrBr.c1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1'</cmd>\n\nThe optional <cmd>USING</cmd> clause specifies an AI model other than the default model.\n    - <cmd>ai_model=’<model_name>’ </cmd>The default ai_model is '2020-07-01'\nExamples:\n    <cmd>predict reaction batch from list ['BrBr.c1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1CCO' , 'BrBr.c1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1']</cmd>\n\nYou can also use previously generated results by optionally using <cmd>use_saved</cmd> at the end of the command and it will use the results of any previously run commands with the same parameters while the toolkit has been installed.\n\n<cmd>predict reaction batch from list ['BrBr.c1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1CCO' , 'BrBr.c1ccc2cc3ccccc3cc2c1'] use_saved</cmd>",
